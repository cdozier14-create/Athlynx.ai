# Transfer Portal Research - Deep Dive

## How the NCAA Transfer Portal Works

### The Basics
- The transfer portal is a compliance tool/database that manages the transfer process
- Players notify their school's compliance officer to enter the portal
- Once in the portal, coaches from ANY school can legally contact the player
- It's essentially a "job board" for college athletes

### Key Data Points Displayed (from 247Sports)

2. **Position** (QB, RB, WR, TE, OL, DL, LB, CB, S, etc.)
3. **Height/Weight** (6-2 / 225)
4. **Status** (Entered, Committed, Transferred)
5. **Previous School** (with logo)
6. **New School** (with logo)
7. **Crystal Ball %** (prediction of where they'll go)

4. **By Rating** - Find top-rated players
5. **By Physical Attributes** - Height/Weight requirements
6. **By Conference** - P5 vs G5 vs FCS experience

### Competitor Platforms

2. **247Sports** - Industry ratings + crystal ball predictions
3. **Rivals** - Traditional recruiting focus

5. **NCAA Official Portal** - Compliance tool only, not public

### Gaps in Current Platforms (ATHLYNX Opportunity)
1. **No NIL Integration** - Players don't show NIL value alongside transfer status
2. **No Direct Messaging** - Coaches can't contact through platform
3. **No Video Highlights** - Have to go elsewhere for film
4. **No AI Matching** - No smart recommendations for fit
5. **No Analytics** - No predictive success metrics
6. **No Agent/Rep Integration** - Players handle everything alone
7. **Limited Filtering** - Can't filter by GPA, eligibility remaining, etc.
